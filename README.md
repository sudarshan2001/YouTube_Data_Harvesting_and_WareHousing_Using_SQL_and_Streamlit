YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing using SQL and Streamlit 📊🛠️
Welcome to my project! This is a tool built with SQL and Streamlit that allows you to harvest data from YouTube channels, store it in a database, and analyze it.

INTRODUCTION: ℹ
This project aims to harvest YouTube data using the YouTube API, store it in a MySQL database, and provide an interface for interacting with the data using Streamlit.
The project allows users to fetch information about YouTube channels, videos, and comments, execute SQL queries for analysis, and delete data associated with specific channel IDs.

FEATURES: 🚀
# Fetch data of YouTube channels, videos, and comments using the YouTube API.

# Execute SQL queries to analyze the data.
# Delete data associated with specific channel IDs.

PREREQUISITES: 🚀
# Python 
# Streamlit
# MySQL database
# Google API key for YouTube Data API v3
# MySQL Connector Python
# Google API Client Library for Python
